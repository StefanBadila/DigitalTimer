# DigitalTimer

The project is a digital timer that counts up to 60 seconds, displaying numbers on 7-segment displays. Each 4-bit output from the counters is converted via a binary-to-7-segment decoder. The circuit includes start/stop and reset switches for controlling the timer's operation.

# Description
My Digital Timer project involves creating a PCB circuit for a timer counting up to 60 seconds. It uses a 1 Hz clock signal generated by an NE555 oscillator, connected to counters for seconds and tens of seconds. The 4-bit output is decoded to drive 7-segment displays. Components include 7-segment displays, 4-bit counters, decoders, logic gates, and a JK flip-flop. The circuit has switches for start/stop and reset. Design was completed in KiCad with a 2-layer, 9 cm x 7 cm PCB layout.
